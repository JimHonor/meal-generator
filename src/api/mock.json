      "strInstructions": "Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl. Make a well in the middle and add the yeast.\r\nMeanwhile, warm the milk and butter in a saucepan until the butter melts and the mixture is lukewarm.\r\nAdd the milk mixture and egg to the flour mixture and stir until the contents of the bowl come together as a soft dough. (You may need to add a little extra flour.)\r\nTip the dough onto a generously floured work surface. Knead for five minutes, adding more flour if necessary, until the dough is smooth and elastic and no longer feels sticky.\r\nLightly oil a bowl with a little of the vegetable oil. Place the dough into the bowl and turn until it is covered in the oil. Cover the bowl with cling film and set aside in a warm place for one hour, or until the dough has doubled in size.\r\nLightly grease a baking tray.\r\nFor the filling, knock the dough back to its original size and turn out onto a lightly floured work surface. Roll the dough out into a rectangle 0.5cm/\u00bcin thick. Brush all over with the melted butter, then sprinkle over the brown sugar, cinnamon and dried fruit.\r\nRoll the dough up into a tight cylinder , cut ten 4cm/1\u00bdin slice and place them onto a lightly greased baking sheet, leaving a little space between each slice. Cover with a tea towel and set aside to rise for 30 minutes.\r\nPreheat oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5.\r\nBake the buns in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until risen and golden-brown.\r\nMeanwhile, for the glaze, heat the milk and sugar in a saucepan until boiling. Reduce the heat and simmer for 2-3 minutes.\r\nRemove the buns from the oven and brush with the glaze, then set aside to cool on a wire rack.",
